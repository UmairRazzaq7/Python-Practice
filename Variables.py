#Code:1 = Assign a number to a variable x. Then assign another number to y. Print their sum

x = 20
y = 10.5

sum = x+y
print(sum)

#Code:2 = Create two variables a = 10 and b = 3. Swap their values using a third variable.

a = 10
b = 3
#Swap
temp = a
a = b
b = temp

print("a =" ,a)
print("b =" ,b)

#Code:3 = Create a variable radius = 5. Calculate the area using formula area = pi * radius * radius.

radius = 5 
#We know value of Pi
pi = 3.14

area = pi * radius * radius

print("area = " , area)


#Code:4 = Assign your age to a variable my_age. Create another variable friend_age and find the average.

my_age = 20
friend_age = 18

average_age = (my_age+friend_age)/2

print(f"Average age is : {average_age}")


#Code:5 = Create a variable x = 7. Without using any new variables, double the value of x.

x = 7
x = 7 * 2

print("x =",x)
